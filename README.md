# LVooooors @ ETHGlobalLondon 2024

## tl;dr:

We fix LVR (loss versus rebalancing, esp. wrt CEX) in Uniswap v4 pools by distributing the arbitrage MEV back to LPs. We achieve this with v4 hooks that utilise external SUAVE calls to run credible second-bid (Vickery) auctions for top-of-block swap rights.

## Design

### Goals

- Achieve a mechanism that would lead to redistributing a maximum amount of LVR MEV back to LPs without rendering the DEX unresponsive or otherwise unattractive.

### Assumptions

- Block builders will "knapsack" mempool transactions into an ordering that actually puts the special arb-swap transaction from the auction winner first within all pool transactions for said block ("pool-top-of-block") because it's the only ordering that doesn't lead to a revert
  - This will be particularly non-problematic if the system attracts enough traffic to be seen by block builers who would render their algorithms aware of the auction-winning mechanism
- There will be MEV potential so more sophisticated actors will submit non-zero bids close to the block deadline
  - Timing needs to be in sync between the settlement layer and SUAVE
  - If no traffic/interest, no bid will be submitted and the DEX will be blocked for a block - but this will result in a larger deviation from the real price, increasing the LVR value and increasing the chances that an actor would submit a bid
  - If still no traffic, we could run an altruistic bot to every now and then submit a special zero-value bid to unlock the DEX


## Project Setup

Requires [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh):

```
forge install
```


## Development and Testing

### Local Unit Tests

See [./test](./test), run with `forge test`.


### Anvil

```bash
# start anvil with TSTORE support
# (`foundryup`` to update if cancun is not an option)
anvil --hardfork cancun

# in a new terminal
forge script script/Anvil.s.sol \
    --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
    --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
    --broadcast
```


### Testnet Deployment

Note: Both Ethereum Goerli and Ethereum Sepolia are NOT supported by Uniswap v4 currently.

However, we were able to deploy our hook, create a pool, add liquidity and swap successfully using Arbitrum Sepolia. 

Further testnets presumed to be functional (as of 17 March 2024):

```

To deploy to a testnet, run scripts from [./script](./script), e.g.:
```
forge script script/00_BidRegistry.s.sol \
--rpc-url https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc \
--private-key [your_private_key_on_separbitrum_here] \
--broadcast
```

#### *Deploying your own Tokens For Testing*

Because v4 is still in testing mode, most networks don't have liquidity pools live on v4 testnets. We recommend launching your own test tokens and expirementing with them that:

```
forge create script/mocks/mUNI.sol:MockUNI \
--rpc-url [your_rpc_url_here] \
--private-key [your_private_key_here]
```

```
forge create script/mocks/mUSDC.sol:MockUSDC \
--rpc-url [your_rpc_url_here] \
--private-key [your_private_key_here]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied

When installing dependencies with `forge install`, Github may throw a `Permission Denied` error

Typically caused by missing Github SSH keys, and can be resolved by following the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) 

Or [adding the keys to your ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent), if you have already uploaded SSH keys

### Hook Deployment Failures

Hook deployment failures are caused by incorrect flags or incorrect salt mining

1. Verify the flags are in agreement:
    * `getHookCalls()` returns the correct flags
    * `flags` provided to `HookMiner.find(...)`
2. Verify salt mining is correct:
    * In **forge test**: the *deploye*r for: `new Hook{salt: salt}(...)` and `HookMiner.find(deployer, ...)` are the same. This will be `address(this)`. If using `vm.prank`, the deployer will be the pranking address
    * In **forge script**: the deployer must be the CREATE2 Proxy: `0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C`
        * If anvil does not have the CREATE2 deployer, your foundry may be out of date. You can update it with `foundryup`

## Hackathon Observations

- Arbitrum-Sepolia RPC sometimes throws this error: `It looks like you're trying to fork from an older block with a non-archive node which is not supported. Please try to change your RPC url to an archive node if the issue persists.`. Workaround: Just re-run the deployment script.

## Limitations & Future Work

- Block number needs to be re-enabled; cross-network time-syncing is non-trivial
- Support special zero-value bid type (towards unlocking a potentially stuck DEX during low-traffic periods)
